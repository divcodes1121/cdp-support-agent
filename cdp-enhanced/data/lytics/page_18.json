Updates include refining job statuses to show as Running, a timestamp to indicate when metrics were last updated, instructions for setting up the Chrome Extension, and improved URL matching for easier classification. Lookalike dashboard, onboarding wizard, general UI We've launched the new.home dashboard in beta, fixed issues with report overlaps and onboarding channel selection, and removed distracting icons for a cleaner interface. A bug allowing empty segment selections in job configurations, which led to failures, has been corrected.
