who work directly with our customers to ensure successful implementation and ongoing success. They work directly with Lytics customers on implementations and provide post-implementation technical and strategic support. Through their expertise and commitment, our partners help to streamline processes, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive the effective utilization of our solutions. Types of partners: Subcontractor Implementations - A partner who implements a Lytics customer that has been acquired directly by Lytics. Subcontract Technical Account Management - A partner who helps aid a Lytics-acquired customer with technical management and strategy components as an extension of professional services. Referral Partner (Enterprise or Mid-Market) - Under a reseller agreement partners can bring their customers to Lytics to be supported by licensing and provide implementation or technical account management services at their discretion. Partners interested in becoming resellers and who do not have an agreement with Lytics can contact the Lytics commercial team to create one.
