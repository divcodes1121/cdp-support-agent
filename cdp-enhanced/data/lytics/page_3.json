Introduction Cloud Connect allows you to run complex SQL queries directly against your data warehouse and translate the resulting records into profile attributes and audiences. Cloud Connect in Action 📘Cloud Connect in Action Cloud Connect in Action Check out the solution architecture developed with Google which leverages BigQuery and Analytics Hub in addition to Cloud Connect to create a rich pattern for secure data collaboration and activation. Getting Started Accessing Cloud Connect Cloud Connect is available to all Lytics customers. If you don't currently have access via the product switcher at the top of the primary navigation, contact support or your account management team. Common Use-cases Cloud Connect unlocks many use cases enabling marketers to segment their customers based on any attributes stored in their database. A few examples include: Time Window: All users who did not log in last month.
