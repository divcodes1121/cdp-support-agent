Sync Feed Audience Event Feed Event Event Audience Event Event Amplitude provides product analytics that helps companies leverage cross-platform behavioral data to drive user growth. Supported Features Analytics Data Export Real-Time Dashboards Retroactive Funnels Prerequisites To activate mParticleâs integration with Amplitude, you need the Amplitude API Key for each app that youâd like to set up. Your API key is listed on the Amplitude Project Settings page. The Amplitude integration requires the mParticle Amplitude Kit when connected to a web input. If you are initializing the web SDK using the Snippet Option then the Kit is automatically included for you. If you are Self Hosting the SDK then you need to add this kit manually into your source code. Data Processing Notes mParticle will forward User Identities and Attributes to Amplitude, even if there are no events in the batch. Device/User ID Mapping Every event in Amplitude has a main Device ID field. mParticle populates this field as follows: For Android, the Android ID (falling back to the Android Advertising ID if unavailable) For iOS, the IDFA (falling back to the IDFV if unavailable) For Roku, the Roku Advertising ID (falling back to the Roku Publisher ID if not available) For FireTV, the Fire Advertising ID. Amplitude also has dedicated fields for particular Device IDs, such as IDFA and Android ID. These will be populated if the ID is available. See Field Mappings, for more information. Amplitude requires either a Device ID or a User ID. User ID can be mapped as Email, Customer ID or mParticle ID. If no accepted identifiers are present, data will not be forwarded. Forwarding Web Data By default, mParticle forwards web data to Amplitude client-side, by directly invoking Amplitudeâs Javascript methods. Optionally, you can choose to forward web data server-to-server in the Connection Settings. Note that if you choose this option, your incoming data must have your selected User ID to be forwarded. Data Localization By default, mParticle sends data to the Amplitude organizationâs US endpoint for the HTTP API, but Amplitude offers a different endpoint for EU organizations. In mParticle, the Amplitude Organization Configuration Setting allows you to select a target Amplitude organization location. Event Data Mapping Screen Views mParticle will forward all screen views to Amplitude with the Amplitude Event Type set to âViewed ScreenNameâ, where ScreenName is the screen name passed to the logScreen SDK method (or the name of the screenâs Activity class if youâre using automatic screen tracking on Android). Session Forwarding mParticle will forward all session start and session end events to Amplitude with the Amplitude Event Type set to session_start and session_end. eCommerce Event Forwarding Each valid eCommerce event sent to mParticle is expanded into multiple events before being translated and forwarded to Amplitude. While this expansion applies to all eCommerce transactions, the resulting events are dependent on the type of eCommerce event being forwarded and the number of products in the event. Note: mParticle will not attempt to forward eCommerce Events to Amplitude which contain no Products. The eCommerce events resulting from the expansion that may be forwarded to Amplitude are: Transaction level events (e.g. eCommerce - Purchase) Item level events (e.g. eCommerce - Purchase - Item) Revenue events (e.g. [Amplitude] Revenue) Transaction Event One Transaction Event is forwarded to Amplitude for every valid eCommerce event provided. Contains a summary of the transaction, including a JSON array of the products sent in the initial eCommerce event. Item Events One Item Event is forwarded to Amplitude for every product inside the provided eCommerce event. Each Item event contains information about one of the products in the provided eCommerce event. Revenue Event One Revenue Event is forwarded to Amplitude for every valid Purchase or Refund eCommerce event provided. Otherwise none is sent. The name of the Revenue Event is set by Amplitude, and contains revenue information about the Purchase or Refund event. eCommerce Event Naming Each valid eCommerce event sent to mParticle will result in a transaction level event being sent to Amplitude. This event contains a summary of the transaction, including a JSON array of the products sent in the initial eCommerce event. The name given to the Transaction and Item Level Events is determined from the Product Action provided on the eCommerce Event sent to mParticle. Custom Event Forwarding Custom events logged via mParticleâs logEvent SDK method and their attributes will be forwarded to Amplitude, with the event name passed to logEvent as the Amplitude Event Type. An event name must be specified or an error will be returned. Attribution Custom Event Forwarding Attribution Custom events will be forwarded to Amplitude prefixed with the attribution provider in the event name. For example, [AppsFlyer] attribution. Event Attributes that are included with the event are forwarded to Amplitude in user_properties, also prefixed with the attribution provider. Push Registration mParticle will forward all push registration events to Amplitude with the Amplitude Event Type set to Push Registration. All Field Mappings defined in this documentation will be forwarded too. Application State Transition Forwarding If the Send Application State Transitions setting is enabled, Application State Transition events will be forwarded to Amplitude as follows: Field Mappings Server to Server Web Requests Only for web requests, mParticle will extract OS and browser info from HTTP user agent. Similar to Amplitudeâs SDK behavior, os_name and os_version will be populated with browser info. For that reason, mParticle will send 2 additional Custom User Properties, web_os_name and web_os_version, that will contain OS info. See Amplitudeâs doc. mParticle will also populate device_brand and device_model from the HTTP user agent if the Extract Device Family from User Agent setting is enabled. With this setting enabled, if mParticle cannot determine the device brand or model, it will populate device_brand with the same value as is set for web_os_name. Note, the device values may differ slightly between S2S events and events sent through the Amplitude web kit.
