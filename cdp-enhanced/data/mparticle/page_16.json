The following video provides an overview of the Activity dashboard: Overview The Activity Overview tracks basic stats for your workspace: All metrics can be filtered by date range, environment and input. Identity Displays summary metrics for identity data collected about your users: % of Users: The percentage of users that have a given identity type. Overlaps: The percentage of users and count that have a combination of the two given identity types. This section is filterable by the date range, environment and input options at the top of the page. Connections Displays summary information representing the current workspaceâs usage, showing the following metrics: Inputs Active Platforms: Count of platforms configured with credentials. Active Feeds: Count of configured inbound feeds. Custom Events: Count of custom events received. User Attributes: Count of user attributes received. Outputs Active Event Integrations: Count of active event configurations. Active Audience Integrations: Count of active audience configurations. Active Real-time Audiences: Count of active real-time audiences. Standard Audiences: Count of âreadyâ Standard Audiences. User Activity The User Activity view allows you to see a detailed summary of data associated with a single user. Note that only users with the Admin or Support roles can access the User Activity view. To find a user, begin entering any known ID for the user, an email address, customer ID, device ID, etc. The ID must match exactly to return a profile. If multiple profiles are returned, select the user you want from the list. User Search You can search for any element in your Identity Set. To perform a search do the following: Navigate to the Activity > User Activity screen. The User Search dialog displays on the screen. Enter the search terms in the search field. You can narrow your search by clicking the Any Profile field drop-down and selecting any field that is part of your Identity Set. Enter the search terms in the search field. You can narrow your search by clicking the Any Profile field drop-down and selecting any field that is part of your Identity Set. You can search for users that belong to a group identity by searching for the group identifier or group attribute for the group. You can search for users that belong to a group identity by searching for the group identifier or group attribute for the group. Click the Search button. The screen refreshes and search results are displayed in the Information screen. View individual results by clicking a row. From the individual results you can do the following: Submit a New GDPR Request. For more information about GDPR requests, see Subject Requests View User Events by clicking the Events tab or by scrolling to the bottom of the screen and clicking the View User Events button Expand any of the sections on the Information screen for more information about your results The information shown on this screen is explained in the following sections. Information The following user information will be displayed if available: User Details mParticle ID Customer ID Email Address First and last seen dates (across all workspaces) Workspace Usage First and last seen dates (for the individual workspace) Data Inputs and Partner Feeds the user has appeared in. Device ID - only one Device ID will be shown, for the most recently seen device. The Advertising ID (IDFA or GAID) will be shown for preference, with the Vendor ID (IDFV or Android ID) as a fallback. Devices List of all devices, including the date the device was last seen, device platform (iOS, Android, etc) and whether Limit Ad Tracking is enabled for the device. User Attributes List of all available user attributes. Display priority is given to reserved user attributes: Age First Name Last Name Gender Mobile Number Address City State Zip Code Country All other user attributes will be displayed in alphabetical order. User attribute values may be updated by different inbound data streams. For example, a profile may be created, attributes may be added, updated, or deleted. Each change triggers a timestamp change for the altered attribute. When resolving differences in attribute values for the same profile, the value with the latest timestamp is used. Attribution A list of campaigns, showing Partner and Campaign name. Audience Membership A list of all Audiences the user is a member of. Events The Events tab will show a timeline of historical event data from the user, up until the previous day. Events can be filtered by Date, Input, Event Type and Device. In addition to filtering, you can also choose to highlight selected event names in the timeline. Events are grouped in batches, with the input source in bold. Click a batch heading to view common attributes for the batch, or an event name to view attributes for the event. eCommerce events show details for the transaction and also for each product, including quantity and total price per product. Click the Link button in the details view to copy a sharable direct link to the event to your clipboard. As with the Live Stream You can expand any event or batch to view the raw JSON data. Edit a user profile The User Activity View allows you to manually edit certain properties of individual user profiles. This can be useful if you need to correct profile data and you want the updated profile data to be immediately forwarded to your downstream connections. Whenever you modify user profile data, you must select one of your configured inputs. This allows mParticle to route your changes through that input, updating the user profile, before finally forwarding the changes to any active, connected outputs. Edit a profileâs user attributes To edit a profileâs user attributes: Navigate to Activity > User Activity using the left-hand nav bar. Find the profile you want to edit by searching for one of the profileâs identifiers under User Search. On the Information tab for the profile, scroll to the User Attributes section and click the Edit pencil icon next to the mParticle workspace where you want to make your changes. Remember that user attributes are scoped at the workspace level, so a profile that exists in multiple workspaces may contain different attributes in each workspace. On the Information tab for the profile, scroll to the User Attributes section and click the Edit pencil icon next to the mParticle workspace where you want to make your changes. Remember that user attributes are scoped at the workspace level, so a profile that exists in multiple workspaces may contain different attributes in each workspace. In the Edit modal, select one of your configured and active inputs. The changes you make will be sent to every output that is connected to the input you select. If you donât want your changes sent to your downstream outputs, create or select an input that has no connected outputs. The Edit modal displays a list of the profileâs attributes and attribute values. To change an attribute value, modify or replace it using the text box to the right of the attributeâs name. To permanently delete an attribute from a profile, click the delete trash icon next to the attribute. After youâve made your changes, click Update. Edit a profileâs consent values Navigate to Activity > User Activity using the left-hand nav bar. Find the profile you want to edit by searching for one of the profileâs identifiers under User Search. On the Information tab for the profile, scroll to the Consent and Compliance section and click the Edit pencil icon next to the mParticle workspace where you want to make your changes. Remember that user consent and compliance values are scoped at the workspace level, so a profile that exists in multiple workspaces may contain different values in each workspace. On the Information tab for the profile, scroll to the Consent and Compliance section and click the Edit pencil icon next to the mParticle workspace where you want to make your changes. Remember that user consent and compliance values are scoped at the workspace level, so a profile that exists in multiple workspaces may contain different values in each workspace. In the Edit modal, select one of your configured and active inputs. The changes you make will be sent to every output that is connected to the input you select. If you donât want your changes sent to your downstream outputs, create or select an input that has no connected outputs. The Edit modal lists the profileâs consent purposes (which are not editable) and the corresponding consent values. You can edit a consent value by entering either true or false in the text box. After youâve made your changes, click Update. Edit a profileâs user identities Navigate to Activity > User Activity using the left-hand nav bar. Find the profile you want to edit by searching for one of the profileâs identifiers under User Search. On the Information tab for the profile, look for the User Details section and click the Edit pencil icon. Remember that user identities values are scoped at the organization level: a userâs identities are consistent between all workspaces in your mParticle organization. On the Information tab for the profile, look for the User Details section and click the Edit pencil icon. Remember that user identities values are scoped at the organization level: a userâs identities are consistent between all workspaces in your mParticle organization. In the modal that appears, select one of your configured and active inputs. The changes you make will be sent to every output that is connected to the input you select. If you donât want your changes sent to your downstream outputs, create or select an input that has no connected outputs. To edit one of the profileâs identities, enter the new value in the text box to the right of the user identity. To delete an identity from a profile, click the delete trash icon. After youâve made your changes, click Update. Add an identity to a profile To add an identity to a user profile: Repeat steps 1-4 of Edit a profileâs user identities. Click Add Identity. Use the left dropdown menu to select the type of identity to add, and enter the value of the new identity in the text box on the right. Click Update. System Alerts The System Alerts dashboard reports all errors returned when forwarding data to your connected outputs. This dashboard helps you to find any connections that are failing to forward data, and it can help you to begin debugging a connection you already know is experiencing problems by highlighting the specific errors reported. System Alerts dashboard To view system alerts, log into your mParticle account and navigate to Activity > System Alerts in the left nav bar. The System Alerts dashboard lists all of your connections sorted by their alert volume, from high to low according to alerts reported during the last 12 hours. You can view alerts reported during different date ranges by using the Date dropdown menu. To view alerts reported for only the production or development environment, select the environment using the Environment dropdown menu. You can also look for a specific connection with the search bar. Alert details To view details on the specific alerts reported for a connection, select it from the list labeled Connections. The alerts displayed are sorted by volume and organized according to their type. To view the volume of alerts for each input, click the + icon next to the alert type. You can search for a specific alert using the search bar on the System Alerts dashboard. The following alert types are supported: Event Forwarding The Event Forwarding report provides information on your appâs incoming event data and the data that is forwarded to enabled output event services. This is where you can verify how much data mParticle captured per event, and how much data was forwarded. If multiple configurations are enabled for an integration, the data sent to each configuration will be shown separately. We recommend checking this report if you notice any discrepancies in your vendor dashboards. The report displays a daily summary of events, plus counts for each message type and event name, along with the inbound and outbound counts for each enabled service. By default a summary of data for a full day is shown, but you can also select a specific hour to display hourly data. You may notice differences between an inbound data count and an outbound data count. There are several reasons these differences may occur. Here are some good questions to start with: Did you enable/disable the service on the date in question? Are you using data filters? Is the message type not supported by the integration? Have you chosen configuration or connection settings that exclude certain message types? Are you sending commerce events that are expanded before being forwarded? Commerce Event Types and Event Forwarding Four events, called commerce events, capture information about financial transactions: product commerce events, purchase or refund commerce events, promotion commerce events, and impression commerce events. Commerce events behave differently from other events: If the event is forwarded using an mParticle SDK with an embedded kit that doesnât implement logCommerceEvent, then the event is expanded to ensure that no data is lost. If the event is forwarded server-to-server or using an mParticle SDK with an embedded kit that does support logCommerceEvent, then no expansion is needed, and no data is lost. In addition, the expansion behavior is different depending on the commerce event type: Product commerce events and impression commerce events expand to one event per product. Purchase or refund commerce events add an additional event with the total value. Promotion commerce events expand to one event per promotion action type such as âclickâ or âview.â For more details, see the iOS SDK or Android SDK documentation. Was this page helpful?",
